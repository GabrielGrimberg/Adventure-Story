# Unity Work

A repository for all my Unity projects that I make while learning Unity.

## Prison Break
An adventure story where the user uses the keyboard to change game states for the story.

- A simple narrative type of game.
- The mouse is used to progress through the game.

## Number Guesser
A simple number guessing game where the user guesses a number and follows the instructions set out 
by the Unity UI system. 

- When pressing play the computer will generate a number.
- You will be asked if the number is higher, lower or correct.
- Using your mouse you may select these options.
- The computer has an X amount of tries to guess your number.
